#Question The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

#1 What are Union Types?
    A union type allows a value to be one of several types in a variable or functions. It's like saying, "This can be either string type or number type or any other type."

-Union in variable Example:
    let value: string | number;

-Union in funciton Example:
    function Person(age: string | number): string | number {

    }

#2 What are Intersection Types?
    An intersection type combines multiple types into one place. Itâ€™s like saying, "This must have all the properties of string and number or any other type." Both types must be available or typescript will give error!

-Intersection Example:
    type Person = { name: string };
    type Employee = { employeeId: number };
    type Worker = Person & Employee;
    const john: Worker = { name: "John", employeeId: 123 };


#Key Takeaways
    1.Use union types for "either-or" scenarios.
    2.Use intersection types for "must-have-both" scenarios.
